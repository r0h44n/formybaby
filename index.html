    <h1>To My Dearest Wajiha</h1>
    <p>
        Wajiha baby, thank you so much for coming into my life. You have no idea how much you mean to me,
        and how deeply I've always wanted to be yours. From the very beginning, you've brought light into
        places I didn’t even know were dark. I’m so grateful for you — for your love, your patience, and
        every little effort you’ve made just to make me smile.
    </p>
    <p>
        You’re truly one of a kind. You're kind-hearted, thoughtful, and incredibly beautiful — inside and
        out. Every time I hear your voice, I feel a kind of peace I can’t explain. It’s like everything wrong
        in the world fades away. Your laugh? It’s the sweetest sound I know, and I could listen to it forever.
        You make my world better just by being in it.
    </p>
    <p>
        I want you to know that no matter what life throws your way, I’ll be here. Your Rohaan is always by
        your side — ready to support you, comfort you, and love you with everything he has. You’re not alone,
        not now, not ever. I love you more than words could ever say.
    </p>
    <p>Forever yours, <br>Rohaan</p>
</body>
