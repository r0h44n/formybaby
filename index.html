    <h1>To My Dearest Wajiha</h1>
    <p>
        Wajiha baby, thank you so much for coming into my life. You have no idea how much you mean to me,
        and how deeply I've always wanted to be yours. From the very beginning, you've brought light into
        places I didn’t even know were dark. I’m so grateful for you for your love, your patience, and
        every little effort you’ve made just to make me smile.
    </p>
    <p>
        You’re truly one of a kind. You're kindhearted, thoughtful, and incredibly beautiful. Every time I hear your voice, I feel a kind of peace I can’t explain. It’s like everything wrong
        in the world fades away. Your laugh? It’s the sweetest sound I know, and I could listen to it forever.
        You make my world better just by being in it. You have made my life easier you removed every problem listening to you yap for hours is my favourite thing. Your laugh is the sweetest sound to me.
        I could listen to it forever and never get tired. You have always been so loyal to me, even when things are not easy. That kind of love is rare, and I feel lucky every single day to have it from you.
        I appreciate every little thing you do, every message, every call, every moment you give to me. Thank you for being such a strong and loving person.
        I promise to never take your love for granted, and to always stand by your side.
        Wajiha, your brown eyes are the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen. They have a special shine that no one else has. I could stare into them forever and still feel like I’m seeing something new every time. They’re my favorite part of you.
        Wajiha, thank you again for everything you’ve done for me. You’ve given me love, care, and support in ways I never expected. 
        You’ve stood by me in my best and worst moments without ever changing how you see me. I appreciate every little thing the late-night talks, the sweet messages, the times you listened when I needed it most. 
        Your love is something I’ll never stop being thankful for. You make me feel seen, understood, and truly loved. I don’t know what I did to deserve someone like you, but I promise I’ll always try to make you feel as special as you make me feel every day.
